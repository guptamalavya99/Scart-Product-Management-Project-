 # **Scart: AI-Powered Nutrition Integration**
## **A Product Management Case Study**

### Overview
Scart is an AI-powered nutrition integration designed for quick-commerce grocery apps. This product management case study aims to redefine healthy grocery shopping by solving "nutrition blindness" at checkout.

### The Problem
In the rush for 10-minute deliveries, grocery apps are optimized for speed, causing users to ignore nutrition information. This leads to impulse buying of unhealthy items and significant post-purchase regret.

### The Solution: Smart Cart Health Integration

We are building a non-intrusive nutrition dashboard integrated directly into the cart to enable healthier decision-making instantly.

### Key MVP Features:

⦁	**Smart Badges (Prevention)**: Contextual tags, such as "High Sugar" or "High Protein," displayed directly on product listing pages during browsing.

⦁	**Cart Health Score (Awareness)**: A dynamic 0-100 score visible in the cart, calculated based on the weighted average of the nutritional profiles of edible items. The score is displayed in a colored ring: Green (80-100), Orange (50-79), and Red (0-49).

⦁ **AI Smart Swaps (Action)**: An algorithm detects unhealthy items (e.g., those with "Red Badges") and presents a "View Swap" button. Clicking it opens a modal suggesting a healthier alternative, allowing for a one-tap switch that immediately updates the price and health score.

### Target Audience

⦁ **Primary Persona:** 
Rahul ("The Impulse Buyer") - A 28-year-old tech-savvy professional in Bangalore who wants to eat better but lacks the time to decode food labels. He feels guilty after ordering convenience food.

⦁ **Secondary Persona:**
 Ananya ("The Fitness Conscious") - A user focused on meeting specific daily nutrition goals who needs detailed macro breakdowns displayed directly in the cart.

### Strategy & Roadmap

⦁ Using the **RICE Framework** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), we prioritized features for the MVP (Phase-1) that offered high reach and impact with low effort, such as the Cart Health Score and Smart Badges.

⦁ **Future Vision (Phase-2)** includes high-effort features like an AI Goal-Based Assistant, a Macro Comparator tool, and Gamification to earn "Health Coins".

### Go-To-Market Strategy

The launch is structured in a phased approach:

⦁ **Phase 1:** Alpha (1-2 weeks): Internal test in Bangalore to validate tags and fix bugs.

⦁ **Phase 2:** Beta (1 month): City launch in Mumbai and Bangalore to test latency and measure initial adoption.

⦁ **Phase 3:** National Launch (Month 2): Full marketing push across India, including influencer campaigns with "truth-tellers" to validate data transparency.

### Success Metrics (KPIs)

⦁ **North Star Metric:** % of Carts with a Health Score > 70 (Target: 25%).

⦁ **Engagement Metric:** Swap Adoption Rate (Target: 10%).

⦁ **Guardrail Metric:** Cart Abandonment Rate must stay < 20% to ensure health warnings do not hurt revenue.
